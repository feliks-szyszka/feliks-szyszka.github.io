# My Portfolio's Website

A modern portfolio designed using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The design features a clean, minimalistic aesthetic with a focus on the popular "neumorphism" style—soft shadows and subtle depth bring each element to life, giving a smooth and tactile user experience.

## What's Inside

- Custom-built sections for showcasing projects, skills, and contact details.
- Interactive and responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices.
- No external frameworks—pure HTML, CSS, and a tiny little bit of JavaScript.

## Customization

Feel free to use the neumorphic elements, shadows, or colors by modifying the included CSS files. (Licence: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)
